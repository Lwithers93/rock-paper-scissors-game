# rock-paper-scissors-game
A rock paper scissors terminal program, written in basic python.

# background
This project was designed to be a simple addition to my portfolio, as part of a python skills bootcamp. 
The idea is for this program to demonstrate my understanding of logic and its use in python terminal programs. 

# functionality
We all know the game! It's rock, paper, scissors! 

On running the program in the terminal:
- The user is greeted and asked to enter 'rock', 'paper, or 'scissors'.
- The user is then shown both their own choice, and a randomly shown "computer" choice.
- The user is shown the outcome of the game (win, loss, draw).
- The user is then shown a scoreboard (their score vs the "computer" score)
- The user is then asked if they would like to continue playing.
- If they continue, the process repeats.
- If they choose to end the game, they are told the overall winner and shown an exit message.
